* NOTE: To participate in MCLP, including by giving a talk or demo, you do not need to work currently and directly on proofs and verification. These fields are in active developments. Your strong interest in contributing to such work is important.

Registration for MCLP is free and required for participation.
Registration form is accessible on the website of the EuroProofNet Symposium:
https://forms.gle/QLFzh3Ugv5WgkhZr7

https://europroofnet.github.io/eligibility/

You are very welcome to register and participate in MCLP, by funding from your side. There might be some (small) possibility for funding from COST Action EuroProofNet.

Applications for reimbursement of travel costs through EuroProofNet is part of the registration form.

To give a talk or demo, the submission Web page for proposed titles and abstracts is EasyChair of MCLP 2025:

Submission:
https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=mclp2025

Deadline: still open for contributed talks, by funding from your side.

Please use LaTeX with Springer LNCS package or Microsoft Proceedings Word Templates:

https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs

The abstract should be short, about 1/2 page, and in addition, as many references as you reasonably need. You will have the possibility to update it around the time of the MCLP.

We shall arrange publications in two stages:
(1) by Institut Pascal, proceedings of talks and presentations
(2) post conference special volume of extended papers

**DESCRIPTION:**
Mathematical and computational linguistics for proofs. Mathematical linguistics (MathLing) is an interdisciplinary area providing theoretical foundations of computer science, as well as syntax and semantics of natural and formal languages, including for mathematical logic in theorem provers, proof assistants, model checkers, verification of programs, software and hardware.

Computational linguistics (CompLing) is a subfield of MathLing, which provides computational processing of formal and natural (human) languages by computational theories and algorithms for:

- Parsing formal and natural languages in mathematics
- Computational syntax-semantics interfaces
- Computational processing of language, by mathematical logic and other approaches, e.g., graphical, diagrammatic, numerical, algebraic, statistical, and other related methods
- New hybrid integrations of approaches of mathematical logic and other methods.

**OBJECTIVES:**
MCLP aims at initiating new directions of research on the use of natural language in proof assistants, provers, and other related systems.

MCLP covers the following areas of theories and applications, from the perspectives of current and future use of natural language in proof systems:

- Mathematical theories, with a focus on computational approaches to formal and natural languages
- Type Theories, including Dependent Type Theories
- Applications in domain specific areas, for using provers, in areas of mathematics
- Applications to other domain specific areas, e.g., health systems, medical sciences, forensics, judiciary proceedings, legal laws, transport, etc.
- Specialised formal, specification, and natural languages, e.g., specific fragments and instances depending on domains of specific areas, or generalized over groups of domains.

The program of MCLP shall include talks, presentations, and sessions of discussions.
The focus is on computational approaches to natural language used in mathematical texts.

**TOPICS:**
We invite contributed talks, in the above areas, relevant to the following topics, with a focus on formal and natural language in proof and verification systems, without being limited to them:

- Theories of Computation
- Theories of Information
- Type Theories
- Computational Methods of Inferences in Natural Language
- Computational Theories and Systems of Reasoning in Natural Language
- Transfer of reasoning in natural language to theorem provers, or vice versa
- Transfer of reasoning between natural language, theorem provers, model checkers, and various computational assistants
- Translations between natural language of mathematics and formal languages of proof and verification systems
- Computational Grammar, Syntax, Semantics, Syntax-Semantics Interfaces
- Interfaces between morphology, lexicon, syntax, semantics, speech, text, pragmatics, with a focus on mathematical texts
- Parsing of formal and natural language
- Multilingual Processing
- Large-Scale Grammars of Natural Languages
- Controlled Languages of Mathematics
- Interdisciplinary, Integrated, and Hybrid Methods
