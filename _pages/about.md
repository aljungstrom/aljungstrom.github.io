I am a Ph.D. student in the computational mathematics division of the
department of mathematics at Stockholm University. Here, I'm doing a
Ph.D. in homotopy type theory under the supervision of Anders
Mörtberg.

My primary research interests are synethetic homotopy theory and
computer formalisation, primarily in Cubical Agda. So far, my project
has mainly concerned the formalisation of cohomology theories and
Guillaume Brunerie's Ph.D. thesis.

## Current projects
### The Steenrod squares in HoTT (joint with David Wärn)
David and I are trying our best to develop the theory of Steenrod squares in HoTT. While the Steenrod squares were defined in HoTT by Guillaume Brunerie in 2017, we are trying to verify the various axioms governing this cohomology operation. In particular, we are trying to verify the Cartan formula, Adem relations and the suspension axiom.

### Symmetric monoidal smash products in HoTT
The fact that smash products are symmetric monoidal has turned out to be pretty hard to prove. While Floris van Doorn, in his Ph.D. thesis, made a serious attempt at proving this fact, there was still a crucial gap in the argument. I have been working on a different proof of this fact, and recently finished the formalisation in Cubical Agda. I am currently working on writing this up into something readable.

### Whitehead products in HoTT
Whitehead products were extensively
used in Guillaume Brunerie's Ph.D. thesis but few of their algebraic
properties (e.g. bilinearity, graded commutativity, etc.) have been
verified in HoTT. I am currently working on verifying these, both in
pen-and-paper HoTT and in Cubical Agda.
