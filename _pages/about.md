I'm a Ph.D. student in the computational mathematics division of the
department of mathematics at Stockholm University. Here, I'm doing a project on homotopy type theory under the supervision of Anders Mörtberg.

My primary research interests are synethetic homotopy theory and
computer formalisation, primarily in Cubical Agda. So far, my project
has mainly concerned the formalisation of cohomology theories and
Guillaume Brunerie's Ph.D. thesis. I'm interested in anything HoTT related. If you are too and would like to work on something together, please get in touch!

## Current projects
### The Steenrod squares in HoTT (joint with David Wärn)
David and I are trying our best to develop the theory of Steenrod squares in HoTT. While the Steenrod squares were defined in HoTT by Guillaume Brunerie in 2017, we are trying to verify the various axioms governing this cohomology operation. In particular, we are trying to verify the Cartan formula, Adem relations and the suspension axiom.

### Symmetric monoidal smash products in HoTT (close to finished)
The fact that smash products are symmetric monoidal has turned out to be pretty hard to prove in HoTT. While Floris van Doorn, in his Ph.D. thesis, made a serious attempt at proving this fact, there was still a crucial gap in the argument. I have been working on a different proof of this theorem and recently finished the formalisation of it in Cubical Agda. I'm currently working on writing this up as a more readable HoTT book style proof.

### Whitehead products in HoTT
Whitehead products were extensively used in Guillaume Brunerie's Ph.D. thesis but few of their algebraic properties (e.g. bilinearity, graded commutativity, etc.) have been verified in HoTT. I'm currently working on verifying these, both in pen-and-paper HoTT and in Cubical Agda.
